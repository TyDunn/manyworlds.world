Despite the <a href="https://mattturck.com/data2021/">many layers of abstraction</a>, all software development seems to ultimately contribute towards creating a more convincing reflection of either <a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/love-and-ai/">ourselves</a> (from <code>user_id</code> to <code>AI</code>) or the <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">reality that surrounds us</a> (from <code>object_id</code> to <code>VR</code>).</p><p id="00869510-1562-4284-bae3-ace18f60fdc5" class="">

</p><p id="2aa8e107-ff5e-48b8-a5d8-2b81f1983d29" class="">Software is a network of networks through which information flows, which is written in code but still often connected together by us. It is frequently referred to as the Internet—the human collective (i.e. <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-is-us-bea56ae39443">we don’t use the network; we are the network</a>). The Internet collectively wants to create better mirrors because it allows us to run parts of reality with less effort.</p><p id="42cc4966-5b75-4c78-b586-79144fa710fb" class="">
</p><p id="a975dc31-16de-469d-93b6-ea24188975ea" class="">The mirror is a function of the <a href="https://www.retrorabbit.co.za/you-dont-need-ai-you-need-to-know-what-your-data-is/">data we make accessible</a>, which occurs when people or objects generate data that is captured, processed, and stored, ready to be queried and used. When we try to automate parts of reality that are static, software works well. However, most of reality that matters is <a href="https://twitter.com/alienelf/status/1413471906179649544">dynamic</a>, and current software struggles to automate this.</p><p id="16b9e987-e337-4abd-b56c-883673d8ef50" class="">

It is not capable of supporting a high enough <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>, which is necessary to create better models of the more dynamic parts of reality that we want to reflect.</p><p id="01f16ef1-dfec-4b1a-9a06-d0b03a709702" class="">

After feeling the pain caused by the current architecture, the Internet has come up with <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/">ideas</a> for how to refactor core parts of the architecture and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum">started to work on them</a> in an attempt to further accelerate the velocity.</p><p id="2123f61e-c793-4c9e-9fef-785d9352545a" class="">

</p><p id="1f506104-af21-405a-93a4-528aedc4f20a" class="">The appetite of the Internet for a higher <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code> is driving demand for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gC7xJ_98r8">networks operated by themselves</a> because <a href="https://mobiledevmemo.com/metaverse-isnt-here-yet/">central authorities are the primary bottleneck</a>. <a href="https://future.a16z.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/">This shift</a> pushes <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2022/02/ceramic/">data control further towards the edge of the network</a>, where data about users and their context is better captured, processed, and stored.</p><p id="e5ed9c9e-315a-4509-9203-039b531254fd" class="">
</p><p id="ab399afc-bc3c-44b7-ac25-7d0f2fbaa6e6" class="">Right now, data generated by a user or object is separated across disconnected databases for each central authority. Using their collection of narrow snapshots taken from us, central authorities create frequently incorrect and limited reflections. It’s like a mirror of only partial, stiched together images from the past—it leads to undesirable models of ourselves and reality.</p><p id="57afd217-aa9c-48b0-96ab-2960ea5e868c" class="">
</p><p id="2d6c1851-1064-40c6-985d-0bbf8943b0f3" class="">Instead, data is starting to be collected together <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">for each user or object</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md">updated</a> as we evolve as much as possible (i.e. <code>dynamic data</code>). That is, this data is captured, processed, and stored <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/">with the user or object across all applications</a>. This will empower us to create more desirable mirrors that reflect a sort of live video stream of ourselves and our context.</p><p id="33cdd263-9c99-4174-a3fa-e08163ed6cb9" class="">
</p><p id="531f0007-c914-4475-b895-b7be1f005bc1" class="">This better architecture will set us up to create more <code><a href="https://syncedreview.com/2018/11/29/michael-i-jordan-interview-clarity-of-thought-on-ai/">adaptive software</a></code>, which is more aware of changes to users and can use that to improve its behavior. Swiftly updating state changes enable us to have a stream that better represents the past, current, and future that surrounds a piece of information (i.e. a high <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>).</p>

It adapts to us as we steer it, and we adapt to it as it steers us. More <code>adaptive software</code> built using <code>dynamic data</code>, which is made possible by a higher <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>, can help us increasingly steer our past, present, and future individually and collectively.</p> 
</p><p id="f9cb66e8-0373-4793-9f6f-5056217ba927" class="">This can improve our power to collectively shape and reshape the world, so we don't end up with a <a href="https://niccolo.substack.com/p/the-dubrovnik-interviews-marc-andreessen">single monoculture</a> or a <a href="https://archive.transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/63294/Eternal%20Network_Guide_web.pdf">singular truth</a>.

We need to ensure people can connect to the Internet and use it responsibly. We need to create a world we all want to inhabit.
