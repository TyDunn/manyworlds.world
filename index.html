Despite the <a href="https://mattturck.com/data2021/">many layers of abstraction</a>, all software development seems to ultimately contribute towards creating a more convincing reflection of either <a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/love-and-ai/">ourselves</a> (from <code>user_id</code> to <code>AI</code>) or the <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">reality that surrounds us</a> (from <code>object_id</code> to <code>VR</code>).</p><p id="00869510-1562-4284-bae3-ace18f60fdc5" class="">

If we don't believe it fits, we adjust the reflection or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/">reorganize ourselves</a> until it is acceptable and then press play again, automating and merging again.</p><p id="f04421d1-bd36-440d-869d-9ed9f1abc68e" class="">
</p><p id="2aa8e107-ff5e-48b8-a5d8-2b81f1983d29" class="">Software is a network of networks through which information flows, which is written in code but still often connected together by us. It is frequently referred to as the Internet—the human collective (i.e. <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-is-us-bea56ae39443">we don’t use the network; we are the network</a>). The Internet collectively wants to create better mirrors because it allows us to run parts of reality with less effort.</p><p id="42cc4966-5b75-4c78-b586-79144fa710fb" class="">
</p><p id="a975dc31-16de-469d-93b6-ea24188975ea" class="">The mirror is a function of the <a href="https://www.retrorabbit.co.za/you-dont-need-ai-you-need-to-know-what-your-data-is/">data we make accessible</a>, which occurs when people or objects generate data that is captured, processed, and stored, ready to be queried and used. When we try to automate parts of reality that are static, software works well. However, most of reality that matters is <a href="https://twitter.com/alienelf/status/1413471906179649544">dynamic</a>, and current software struggles to automate this.</p><p id="16b9e987-e337-4abd-b56c-883673d8ef50" class="">

It is not capable of supporting a high enough <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>, which is necessary to create better models of the more dynamic parts of reality that we want to reflect.</p><p id="01f16ef1-dfec-4b1a-9a06-d0b03a709702" class="">

</p><p id="0652f101-8946-4c4d-aaa8-8efc4db78618" class="">If we want better models of the dynamic world, we need an architecture that enables a higher <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code> on the network. After feeling the pain caused by the current architecture, the Internet has come up with <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/">ideas</a> for how to refactor core parts of the architecture and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum">started to work on them</a> in an attempt to further accelerate the velocity.</p><p id="2123f61e-c793-4c9e-9fef-785d9352545a" class="">
</p><p id="86182df4-10fb-4e3f-a626-2a0a8cc08dab" class="">Rather than building more platforms on top of TCP/IP, HTTP, etc. (i.e. networks operated by a central authrority), we should build <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs.draft3.pdf">more protocols</a> on top of TCP/IP, HTTP, etc. (i.e. networks operated by themselves). It is now possible because <a href="https://future.a16z.com/tokens-are-a-new-digital-primitive/">tokens can be used as a native primitive of networks</a>, which allows protocol creators to align incentives among network participants and enable the network to become self-sustaining. This can be seen as <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZL4eT1gxnE168Pmw3KyejW6fUfMNzMgeKMgcWJUfYGRj/Placeholder%20Thesis%20Summary.pdf">another cycle in a recurring pattern</a>.</p><p id="d3852ecd-7eda-4bda-ad45-ad305eb5198d" class="">
</p><p id="1f506104-af21-405a-93a4-528aedc4f20a" class="">The appetite of the Internet for a higher <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code> is driving demand for networks operated by central authorities to be challenged by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gC7xJ_98r8">networks operated by themselves</a> because <a href="https://mobiledevmemo.com/metaverse-isnt-here-yet/">those central authorities are the primary bottleneck</a>. This shift not only allows <a href="https://future.a16z.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/">more developers to build on the network together</a> but also pushes <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2022/02/ceramic/">data control further towards the edge of the network</a>, where data about users and their context is better captured, processed, and stored.</p><p id="e5ed9c9e-315a-4509-9203-039b531254fd" class="">
</p><p id="ab399afc-bc3c-44b7-ac25-7d0f2fbaa6e6" class="">Right now, data generated by a user or object is separated across disconnected application databases for each central authority. When a collection of narrow snapshots of information is taken from us and used to create a mirror like this, each central authority ends up with a frequently incorrect, limited, flat reflection. It’s like creating a mirror of only partial, stiched together images from the past—it leads to undesirable models of ourselves and reality.</p><p id="57afd217-aa9c-48b0-96ab-2960ea5e868c" class="">
</p><p id="2d6c1851-1064-40c6-985d-0bbf8943b0f3" class="">Instead, data should all be collected together for each user or object, represented by a specified <a href="http://www.w3.org/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md">update</a> as we evolve as much as possible. This is what happens when <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/">data is captured, processed, and stored with the user or object across all applications</a>. It is what I mean by <code>dynamic data</code>. It would allow us to create more desirable mirrors of ourselves and our reality because they would reflect a sort of live video stream of ourselves and our context.</p><p id="33cdd263-9c99-4174-a3fa-e08163ed6cb9" class="">
</p><p id="104cbb24-7e0b-46eb-9519-d25f62ea12fc" class="">If I update my address, I should only have to do it once. Applications that use it as well as all of my other data benefit from this important, temporally accurate change to my context. In the current architecture, I have to update my address for each application. Sometimes I do this, sometimes I don't, and it takes a long time. Multiply this by all information about me and you realize that every application is operating on data of varying degrees of accuracy that is slowly or never updated.</p><p id="a3dd1acf-799a-4b97-9f5a-c387f9df6ae9" class="">
</p><p id="531f0007-c914-4475-b895-b7be1f005bc1" class="">This better architecture can set us up to create more <code><a href="https://syncedreview.com/2018/11/29/michael-i-jordan-interview-clarity-of-thought-on-ai/">adaptive software</a></code>, which is more aware of changes to users / their context and can use that to improve its behavior. Doing this as close to the person or object and as quickly after its state changes as possible enables us to have a stream that better represents the past, current, and future that surrounds a piece of information. This is what I mean by a high <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>.

It adapts to us as we steer it, and we adapt to it as it steers us. More <code>adaptive software</code> can help us to increasingly steer our past, present, and future individually and collectively. This can increase our ability to collectively shape and reshape the world, rather than end up with a <a href="https://niccolo.substack.com/p/the-dubrovnik-interviews-marc-andreessen">single monoculture</a> and a <a href="https://archive.transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/63294/Eternal%20Network_Guide_web.pdf">singular truth</a>. It can also empower more people to shape and reshape their world, so that <a href="https://interdependence.online/">many worlds can exist</a>.

The metaphor of the mirror should make it clear why we so desperately need to make sure we are not leaving people nor parts of reality out of being reflected.
