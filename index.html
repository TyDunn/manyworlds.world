Despite the <a href="https://mattturck.com/data2021/">many layers of abstraction</a> that everyone in software is building, all development seems to ultimately contribute towards creating a more convincing reflection of either <a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/love-and-ai/">ourselves</a> (i.e. a spectrum from <code>user_id</code> to <code>AI</code>) or the <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">reality that surrounds us</a> (i.e. a spectrum from <code>object_id</code> to <code>VR</code>).</p><p id="00869510-1562-4284-bae3-ace18f60fdc5" class="">

When we believe it does not fit, we adjust the reflection or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/">reorganize ourselves</a> until it is acceptable and then press play on the program, which once again automatically completes something people want done, merging reality and the mirror together.</p><p id="f04421d1-bd36-440d-869d-9ed9f1abc68e" class="">
</p><p id="2aa8e107-ff5e-48b8-a5d8-2b81f1983d29" class="">When I say software here, I really mean the network of networks through which information flows, which is written in code but still often connected together through people. This network of networks is frequently referred to as the Internet—what I see as the online human collective (i.e. <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-is-us-bea56ae39443">we don’t use the network; we are the network</a> after all). The Internet collectively wants to create better mirrors because it allows us to run parts of reality with less effort.</p><p id="42cc4966-5b75-4c78-b586-79144fa710fb" class="">
</p><p id="a975dc31-16de-469d-93b6-ea24188975ea" class="">The mirror is a function of the <a href="https://www.retrorabbit.co.za/you-dont-need-ai-you-need-to-know-what-your-data-is/">data we make accessible</a>. This happens when people or objects generate data that is captured, processed, and stored, ready to be queried and used. When we are trying to automate parts of reality that are usually static, software is able to model it today. However, most of reality that matters to us is <a href="https://twitter.com/alienelf/status/1413471906179649544">dynamic</a>, and current software struggles to automate this.</p><p id="16b9e987-e337-4abd-b56c-883673d8ef50" class="">

The infrastructure we currently use to create software together is not capable of supporting a high enough <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code> to create better models of the more dynamic parts of reality that we want to better reflect.</p><p id="01f16ef1-dfec-4b1a-9a06-d0b03a709702" class="">

</p><p id="0652f101-8946-4c4d-aaa8-8efc4db78618" class="">If we want better models of the dyanmic world with software, we need an architecture that enables a higher <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code> on the network. After increasingly feeling the pain caused by the current architecture over the last two decades, the Internet has come up with <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/">ideas</a> for how to refactor core parts of the architecture and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum">started to work on them</a> in an attempt to further accelerate the <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>.</p><p id="2123f61e-c793-4c9e-9fef-785d9352545a" class="">
</p><p id="86182df4-10fb-4e3f-a626-2a0a8cc08dab" class="">During this wave, rather than building platforms on top of TCP/IP, HTTP, etc. (i.e. networks operated by a central authrority), we will build <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs.draft3.pdf">more protocols</a> on top of TCP/IP, HTTP, etc. (i.e. networks that are operated by themselves). This is now possible because <a href="https://future.a16z.com/tokens-are-a-new-digital-primitive/">tokens can be used as a native primitive of networks</a>, which allows protocol creators to align incentives among network participants and enable the network to become self-sustaining.

</p><p id="1f506104-af21-405a-93a4-528aedc4f20a" class="">The appetitate of the Internet for a greater <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>, so it can better model more of the dynamic world, is driving demand for networks operated by central authorities to be replaced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gC7xJ_98r8">networks operated by themselves</a> because <a href="https://mobiledevmemo.com/metaverse-isnt-here-yet/">those central authorities are the primary bottleneck</a>. This allows <a href="https://future.a16z.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/">more developers to build on the network together</a> because there is no longer a central authority that decides who can and can’t build what, when, and how on the network. It also pushes <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2022/02/ceramic/">data control further towards the edge of the network</a>, where data about users and their context is better captured, processed, and stored.</p><p id="e5ed9c9e-315a-4509-9203-039b531254fd" class="">
</p><p id="ab399afc-bc3c-44b7-ac25-7d0f2fbaa6e6" class="">Right now, data generated by a person or object is separated across disconnected application databases per each central authority, who generally only use the most recent update a user has provided for each part of our data. When a collection of narrow snapshots of information is ripped away from us and used to create a mirror like this, you end up with a frequently incorrect, limited, flat reflection. It’s like creating a mirror of only partial, stiched together images from the past—it leads to undesirable models of ourselves and our reality, esspecially as we don’t stand still.</p><p id="57afd217-aa9c-48b0-96ab-2960ea5e868c" class="">
</p><p id="2d6c1851-1064-40c6-985d-0bbf8943b0f3" class="">Instead, data should all be collected together for each person or object, represented by a specified <a href="http://www.w3.org/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a>, in an append only collection of data structures that are time stamped and updated with us as we evolve as much as possible (with root access for users to steer their history). This is what happens when <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/">data is captured, processed, and stored with the user across all applications</a>. It is what I mean by <code>dynamic data</code>. It would allow us to create more desirable mirrors of ourselves and our reality because they would reflect a sort of live video stream of ourseleves and our context molded by each of us.</p><p id="33cdd263-9c99-4174-a3fa-e08163ed6cb9" class="">
</p><p id="104cbb24-7e0b-46eb-9519-d25f62ea12fc" class="">If I update my address, I should only have to do it once, and it should update everywhere for all applications that have permission to read it. These applications that use my address as well as all of my other data then now benefit from this important, temporally accurate change to my context. In the current architecture, I have to go update my address for each application. This currently happens with varying amounts of delay for some applications and not at all for others. Multiply this by all information about me and my context, and you realize that every application is operating on different data of varying degrees of accuracy that is slowly or never updated.</p><p id="a3dd1acf-799a-4b97-9f5a-c387f9df6ae9" class="">
</p><p id="531f0007-c914-4475-b895-b7be1f005bc1" class="">This better architecture can set us up to create more <code><a href="https://syncedreview.com/2018/11/29/michael-i-jordan-interview-clarity-of-thought-on-ai/">adaptive software</a></code>, which is more aware of changes to users / their context and can use that to improve its behavior. Doing this as close to the DID and as quickly after its state changes as possible enables us to have a stream that better represents the past, current, and future that surrounds a piece of information. This is what I mean by a high <code>velocity of accurate data changes</code>. It will require us to move beyond reflecting partial images from different points in the past and move to reflecting live video streams, while recognizing that even this will still be a fuzzy, lossy reflection of reality, which will also will need to be improved.</p>

It adapts to us as we steer it, and we adapt to it as it steers us. More <code>adaptive software</code> can help us to increasingly steer our past, present, and future individually and collectively. This can increase our ability to collectively shape and reshape the world, rather than end up with a <a href="https://niccolo.substack.com/p/the-dubrovnik-interviews-marc-andreessen">single monoculture</a> and a <a href="https://archive.transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/63294/Eternal%20Network_Guide_web.pdf">singular truth</a>. It can also empower more people to shape and reshape their world, so that <a href="https://interdependence.online/">many worlds can exist</a>.

The metaphor of the mirror should make it clear why we so desperately need to make sure we are not leaving people nor parts of reality out of being reflected.
